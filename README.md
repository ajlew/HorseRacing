# HorseRacing
Using csv data from Punters.com.au VBA script slices and dices the csv file to predict the winning horses. It may select  single runner or several (bundle) or none if the race does not fullfil the criteria. I have here the template. I am in the process of creating a version in Python 3  using Jupyter notebook but its tricky for me to get the engineered 
features correct outputing multiple races like I can using this template.
